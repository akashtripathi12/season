                    <h2 class="title">Autumn <span>Season</span></h2>
                    <p>Autumn, also known as fall in North American English, is one of the four temperate
                        seasons. Outside the tropics, autumn marks the transition from summer to winter,
                        in September or March. Autumn is the season when the duration of daylight becomes 
                        noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably.</p>

                    <p>Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate zones. It occurs
                        between autumn and spring.The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs
                        when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different
                        dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.</p>

                    <p>Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons, succeeding
                        winter and preceding summer. There are various technical definitions of spring, but 
                        local usage of the term varies according to local climate, cultures and customs. When
                        it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and 
                        vice versa.</p>

        <h2>Seasons Of The Year</h2>
        <p>There are four seasons in a year: winter, spring, summer and autumn. Every season is beautiful and pleasant in its own way. Winter is the coldest season of the year. Winters are usually cold, snowy and sometimes very frosty. It isn’t very pleasant to go out because you must wear warm clothing. But winter is a wonderful season for sports. People go skating and skiing and children play hockey and snowballs. Downhill skiing is becoming more and more popular. A lot of people go to the mountains and visit popular winter skiing resorts.</p>
        <p>When spring comes, nature awakens from its long winter sleep. The days grow longer and the nights grow shorter. We can hear birds singing. The snow starts melting and green grass and new green leaves begin to appear. It’s so beautiful to see the new spring leaves, grass and flowers! The sun usually shines brightly, but sometimes it rains.</p>
        <p>Summer is the hottest season. The weather is usually fine, and the sky is blue, clear and cloudless. Summers are usually hot and dry, so it’s a good time to go hiking, fishing or have a nice holiday at the seaside. People try to get away from the city and spend more time in the open air.</p>
        <p>Autumn is a rainy season. The rains are very cold, especially in October and November. One might say that autumn is an unpleasant season. But that’s not right at all! Autumn is very beautiful. The leaves turn yellow, red and brown. At the end of autumn all the ground is covered with fallen leaves. More than that, there is always a spell of fine weather in September or October, when it is warm and sunny. This spell is called Indian summer. Besides, autumn is a wonderful time for going to the country because there are a lot of mushrooms and berries in the forests.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, strong and hot winds blow, which adds difficulties to people living in India. Children enjoy summer vacations during May and June when the heat is at a peak. Usually, the nights are shorter and days are longer during the summer season.  People try to keep themselves cool by wearing light cotton clothes and staying indoors. Eating fresh fruits and vegetables helps in the proper functioning of the digestive system.
        <p>India is a vast country and has diverse climatic conditions. Different parts of the country experience different temperatures and climate depending on several factors such as topography, altitude, latitude, and longitude. The astronomical calendar of Hindu denotes six seasons, namely, spring season, summer, monsoon, autumn, winter, and reveal season. However, the meteorological department of India broadly classifies the seasons in India into four, namely, summer, monsoon (or rainy season), post-monsoon, and winter season.</p>
        <p>India is heavily dependent on monsoon rain for cultivation.  It replenishes the groundwater reserves and fills up dry lakes and rivers.  Monsoon season begins in the last week of June or the first week of July and continues till September. The rainy season or the monsoon season brings respite to Indians, particularly, the farmers. The monsoon showers cool down the earth. It is extremely helpful in the irrigation of crops. A good monsoon rain helps in the high production of Kharif crops. The monsoon clouds originate in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The southern part of the country experiences the first precipitation. Some parts of the country often have to deal with flooding due to heavy downpour.</p>
        <p>The post-monsoon season begins in October and stretches till November. These months have warm days and pleasant nights. The post-monsoon season is a transitory period between the monsoon season and the winter season. It is the shortest season of India.</p> 
        <p>Towards the end of November, nights are longer and day becomes shorter. Winter seasons in India has a span of two to three months. The temperature begins to dip from the first week of December and extends till the last week of February. Some parts of the country experience extremely cold weather whereas other regions near the seashore enjoy the warm and pleasant climate. The northern part of the country is the coldest. Some areas at high altitude experience snowfalls. The minimum winter temperature in India ranges between-15 degrees Celsius and 10 degrees Celsius. People wear woollen clothes to keep themselves warm. Towards the end of February, the weather becomes pleasant in most parts of the country.</p>
        <p>To sum up, I think every season has its own beauty and charm. A new season comes and new activities begin.</p>
